            This project is being facilitated by mist by giving me resources and a timeline. It curbs my procrastination while motivating and guiding me in the path to web developement.

        <h1>College life for me</h1>
        <p>
            So far it has been a couple of months, and genuinely I can almost find nothing bad to talk about this college.. except myself. My sleep schedule and my procrastination both have taken a turn for the worse. Gotta improve that asap. Also I dont think anyone will read this, so I am just writing anything at this point just so the website looks kinda full. I will write the last few lines properly, the content can be anything right. There is a blue coloured bottle infront of me that has water. My roommate has gone to "his home town and that's great fr. So manipal has been till now a good experience. Hope to turn it to the superlative degree.
